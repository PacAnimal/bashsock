# bashsock
A simplistic implementation of the HTTP and WebSocket protocols, in Bash.
It was made on the side while reading the RFC, simply as an exercise.

It does, however, function perfectly, and I've got it running through a reverse
proxy at https://dhampir.no/proxy/bashsock/ in case you want to see what it does.

Take a look at the source code of the page while you're looking at that :)
